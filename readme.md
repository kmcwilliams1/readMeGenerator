This application was challenging, mostly because everything that was applied here was learned only 24 hours prior to coding it. Most of it is copied/pasted from the lessons, but thankfully I understand most of it. This one seems like the case of 'it will come easier about a week after it is taught' which is unfortunate because I would have liked to code it all from scratch but I lack the abilities to do so (for now.) 

No licenses, no bootstrap, just trying things until it worked. 

To test it, just run it in the terminal. I tried to make the sentences make sense, though it wont always work with how it is interpolated from the readme creator to the skeleton, so appologies for the occasional bumpy sentence.

Do i have to link my github and email everytime in a readme? 

Im not sure how to put a gif in this bad boy, so instead I will leave it in the files and link it right here, I assume this will suffice since normally we have to put a picture of it: https://github.com/kmcwilliams1/readMeGenerator/blob/main/gif-of-the-page.gif
Also here is a link to my github: https://github.com/kmcwilliams1/readMeGenerator
and here is one to the deployed website: https://kmcwilliams1.github.io/readMeGenerator/


PS I had to download the gif from github to my machine to get it running, not sure how to do it automatically.

PPS, your fun fact is: Octopuses have three hearts. So i guess they get over heart break more easily than us.
